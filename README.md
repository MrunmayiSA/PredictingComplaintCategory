# Predicting Complaint Category

* Performed feature engineering to extract top product categories
* Converted complaint descriptions into bag of words and applied TF-IDF
* Found the terms that are the most correlated with each of the products using chi-square test
* Created a multinomial naive bayes classifier and predicted category for new complaints
* Applied cross-validation and compared accuracies of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM and Naive Bayes
* Explored the missclassified complaints
* Improved classification accuracy to 0.83 using LSTM
